| A           | Generate a Riemann sum problem where I have to calculate the partition interval Δx for a given function and interval [a,b] with number of subintervals n.                                                                                                                                       | Step 1 – Partition                |
| B           | Generate a problem asking me to write the formula for left, right, and midpoint sample points for a function on [a,b] with n subintervals.                                                                                                                                                      | Step 2 – Sample points            |
| C           | Generate a problem where I must factor the Riemann sum as much as possible, showing constants outside the sum and leaving only terms that depend on i inside.                                                                                                                                   | Step 3 – Factor sum constants     |
| D           | Generate a problem where I must factor constants from the limit as much as possible, but not anything depending on n, before taking the limit n→∞.                                                                                                                                              | Step 4 – Factor limit constants   |
| E           | Generate a Riemann sum problem for a function f(x) on a reasonable interval [a,b], using left, right, or midpoint endpoints. The sum should only involve Σi, Σi², Σi³. Show the problem statement and the formula for the Riemann sum in terms of i and Δx, but do not solve it.                | General full Riemann sum practice |
| F           | Generate a problem giving a function f(x) on an interval [a,b] and ask whether evaluating the Riemann sum would give the total geometric area or just the net signed area. The learner should identify whether the function stays entirely above the x-axis, or goes below it, and explain why. | Step 6 – Signed vs geometric area |
